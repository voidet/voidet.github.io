	<h1>Putting Your Shoes On Is The Hardest Part</h1>
		<p>It’s the old adage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The hardest part of getting fit, is putting your shoes on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s play this out for a little bit. You’ve probably had a time in the past where you’ve promised yourself “tomorrow I’m going to wake up early and go for a run” or “when I get home from work, I’m going to spend an hour working on the back deck”. What actually happens is you never take the first movement at crunch time to make it happen. You either got distracted, demotivated or the snooze button got slammed and you and your trainers got to sleep in longer.</p>

<p>I would like to present various ways that I’ve overcome this first, yet difficult step.</p>

<h2 id="its-all-downhill-when-you-have-routine-on-your-side">It’s all downhill when you have routine on your side</h2>

<p>I want to promise you that once you start taking these difficult first steps, the feeling of resistance, distraction, demotivation will falter. Taking the first step will turn into a natural reflex. You can multitask whilst setting yourself up for the next morning, or unconsciously prepare your mind for the duties that await you when you walk through the front door at home.</p>

<p>Once you have routine on your side, it becomes less of setting up for the task and rather about the task itself.</p>

<h2 id="techniques-to-make-routine-your-friend">Techniques to make routine your friend</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Accountability buddy</strong></p>

    <p>Finding someone to hold you accountable is the easiest means to ensuring you hold the commitment you made to yourself. You’re no longer disappointing yourself, you’re breaking a promise to another individual, friend, group, whatever. I find that this is enough to compel you to break even the deepest of sleeps.</p>

    <p>Its also adds an element of companionship to that you may already look forward to. Yes, it makes it fun! Harness this promise and commitment. Its one thing to lie to yourself and let yourself get away with it. But its another thing to let someone down, and also your image and trustworthiness falter.</p>

    <p>If the activity is rather an individual activity, like, flossing your teeth, then just vocalize to a friend, partner, dog or cat that you will begin flossing your teeth every night. Let your actions have some sort of visibility to build some level of accountability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Join a group</strong></p>

    <p>See where I’m going with this whole social aspect to creating a routine. Another avenue is joining a group, or getting multiple people involved in what you’re setting out to do. Perhaps that is joining a meetup group. Or it could be simply being around people, like going to a library, to start seeing familiar faces. Often people take a lot of joy in going to a cafe and simply being around others as a means of committing to whatever they have set out to achieve (with the bonus of getting coffee and a bagel).</p>

    <p>There are also online forums you can join to participate and help track and keep you in check for your target. Simply by reaching out for assistance and stating to the ether that you will do something, adds a lot more weight to you actually lacing up those trainers, or getting the hammer out, or dusting off the guitar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Set a goal</strong></p>

    <p>Setting a goal sounds like a given, right? Well not having a goal and saying “I’ll go for a run tomorrow” is not a goal. Getting fit, getting to a certain weight, completing the back deck before Christmas time, finishing a book each month, doing yoga 2 times a month, are goals.</p>

    <p>So how do you start with setting a goal? If its sports, give yourself a weight, a distance, a time, a frequency for example. If its a project, a hobby or a ritual, give yourself a deadline, or a quota. Don’t let the activity just become a lonely task. Let you task amount to a step in achieving a goal. It adds more accountability to the task and subsequent tasks thereafter. Set your sights on an attainable goal and nail it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Join a challenge</strong></p>

    <p>There are so many online resources at your disposal for joining a challenge. There are online bookclubs, where you will finish a book before the meetup. There of course are the online sporting resources: Strava, RunKeeper, Fitocracy, MapMyRun, Garmin Connect. There are also forums where you can post your status or mark your activities.</p>

    <p>I personally love seeing DIY projects from the ground up on a forum getting posted in stages. I also love the comments from others which is perpetuating the exponential growth of the project. Its addictive!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep a journal or blog</strong></p>

    <p>Dear diary is powerful tool. Your thoughts on paper is a great reflection tool. Its also a great way to examine thoughts in a slower pace, to which you can analyze future behaviors or set aspirations to work towards. It can be private or it can be public and out in the open as a blog can be. Posting to instagram during an activity also helps build an attachment and spark of excitement to bring you to the first step out or in the door.</p>

    <p>One catch to this however is ensure that it become as much a habit as the task you’re getting into. Make it be as much of the doing the task rather than an auxiliary. Remember, these are tools to support you to build a routine. The sooner you give up blogging or journaling, the sooner you give up building the routine.</p>

<h2 id="get-inspired">Get inspired</h2>

<p>There are plenty of inspiring books out there that I have read that are either rags to riches, or zero to hero. Here are a few that had me totally engrossed in the story:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zqbXJB">Finding Ultra: Rejecting Middle Age, Becoming One of the World’s Fittest Men, and Discovering Myself</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zpKesp">The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zpKIid">Wild</a></li>
