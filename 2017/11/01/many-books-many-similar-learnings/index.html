	<h1>Many Books Many Similar Learnings</h1>
		<p>I’ve read a fair few books in the past 2 years. Some self help books, others specific to management. After a while the messages all seem to blur together. How to have composure, foresight, goal setting, communicating, motivating, leading, physical/mental health, all seem to have a general theme. For the time being I’m going to try and be succinct as possible and provide a list of over arching themes. But I do recommend the following books.</p>

<h2 id="the-books">The books</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2A8VEho">The Effective Manager</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2A8dNvU">Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2A7uibp">The Miracle Morning: The Not-So-Obvious Secret Guaranteed to Transform Your Life (Before 8AM)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2A4R43z">Awaken the Giant Within: How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional, Physical and Financial</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2A8XBue">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2A7eZzv">The Compound Effect</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-themes">The themes</h2>

<p>Now a lot of this can be borrowed from the <a href="http://amzn.to/2A7uibp">Miracle Morning</a>; though that is not to say all of this is limited to the morning. Hal Elrod broke down a lot of the themes into broad sections. I won’t list them out specifically as some can be split up. I do however recommend reading that book as a great first start into some ceremonies you can incorporate into your day…. if you’re not a morning person.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reflection</strong> - gathering thoughts from previous actions or encounters. Articulate them, verbally or written.</li>
  <li><strong>Meditation</strong> - quieten the mind, raise your senses</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization</strong> - imagine where you want to be, or an analogy of a race car driver “If you don’t want to crash, look where you want to go”</li>
  <li><strong>Believe</strong> - change your belief systems. Remove any self imposed limitations on your thoughts and simply do. Holding oneself back is the first step backwards.</li>
  <li><strong>Exercise</strong> - get those endorphins flowing and your attention into the now</li>
  <li><strong>Compound</strong> - small changes in yourself, your routine and your beliefs ultimately compound upon massive change</li>
  <li><strong>Vocabulary</strong> - Flip the negative and deprecative tone to look towards solutions or positive motion</li>
  <li><strong>External Force</strong> - There is some talk of a higher power in some of these books. I previously thought I was on the Nihilist camp; in that, rejection of religion and all the principles and stigma attached. However some books rather linked a belief in any higher power, even if that higher power was a stuffed animal on your desk, as a means of removing self absorbed interest in oneself and shifting focus outside. Interesting concept and a way to remind yourself, you are not the center of the universe… until science proves otherwise.</li>
  <li><strong>Disrupt</strong> - If a mental image comes to mind, you have the ability to distort it and thus alter the image retrieved at a future time. Add color, add tone, add a different perspective. The original emotion will be altered next time you come across this artifact.</li>
  <li><strong>Neural Pathways</strong> - Be aware that your brain is a series of pathways. Like a park, paths form from higher traffic, or, if they’re used more. The more you practice a positive or negative task, the more reinforcement you’re physically forming in your brain. Habits happen, habits can be exercised.</li>
  <li><strong>Connectedness</strong> - Connect with people. Find groups. Find relationships, build networks. Find belonging not find yourself trying to “fit in”.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on Breath</strong> - Like these pathways, reactions become instinctual. Control adrenaline responses and slow the mind by focusing on your breath. Connect your body in a short moment and slow your mind to control your reaction going forward.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="so-what-am-i-doing-with-it">So what am I doing with it?</h2>

<p>It has been great to delve into different practices and start to incorporate them into my daily life. For instance, this falls into the reflection component. However more importantly a lot of these components have opened my eyes up to behaviour and widened my toolset for approaching or confronting issues.</p>

<p>One point I left out of this list is reading. I will not stop reading. Different perspectives open the mind and challenge oneself. I’ll continue to update this post with more books and learnings.</p>
