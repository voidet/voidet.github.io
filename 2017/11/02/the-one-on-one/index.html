	<h1>The one on one structure</h1>
		<p>When I first went headfirst into the EM role I must admit, I was winging it. I went from a tech lead position, to an organically found management position, then when the title flipped it suddenly the game changed. Expectations of conducting 1:1’s were not part of my duties. No one mentioned the purpose of a 1:1, let alone what you do in a 1:1. I have to admit, it was mainly just a sync up on what people were working on. I didn’t like it, it felt… awkward.</p>

<p>The awkwardness got to a point where 1:1’s would start to slip off the calendar. It would only be until something had to be said that we would have a “1:1”. Where did that leave me? Well, in a place where a 1:1 would be a thing to dread. I was in a tight space, little mentorship and no pathway out. I reached out to a friend who put me onto the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2zeUl2h">The Effective Manager</a>.</p>

<p>The book talks about many things. One thing I’ll delve into now from the book is the structure of a 1:1. It helped me effectively use the time in my 1:1’s. By following the structure it made me, and I hope my direct, look forward to 1:1’s.</p>

<h2 id="you-talk">You talk</h2>

<p>A one on one isn’t just you talking to the direct. See a critical component in the employee to manager relationship, is, as you guessed it, trust. You need to build trust, be constantly building it. Too often managers go into one on ones and use it as their venting session, or to just talk about something the direct did wrong. Why would a direct open up to you and confide in you when either a) It’s just you talking or b) you just scold them for something they might of done inadequately. So this first 10mins should be left to your direct to talk.</p>

<p>Open up the 1:1 with something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell me what’s going on in your world?</li>
  <li>How’s your week been?</li>
  <li>What are you up to these days?</li>
  <li>How’d you go this week?</li>
  <li>How are you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Leave it open ended, because really, this 1:1 is mainly about them. If they use the entire time up to speak, then so be it. It’s a great way to build the trust, by showing that this is a safe environment to confide in. Of course try and converse with the individual, prod for more elaboration or provide some additional insight, but this time isn’t yours, it’s all about them.</p>

<h2 id="now-i-talk">Now I talk</h2>

<p>This part is you to provide insight into what you’re up to. Share your perspective on how the team or individual is going. Provide some background story on the week and share some details that may smooth over some uncertainty. It could be a simple status update as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>That outage this week was because of the oracle slave server hanging. That caused an outage downstream and we got hit with a deluge of complaints as we’re the client. I think we might have a post-mortem coming up for it.</li>
  <li>I’ve been trying to get some developers from other teams to come over and talk about MVVM with us.</li>
  <li>We’re doing well with recruitment, I want to thank you for your involvement with that.</li>
  <li>Let’s talk about James leaving, how do you think the team is? I’m thinking perhaps we get an API engineer in as a replacement to better purpose the role for a gap in our team skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is another 10mins worth of just you talking. Don’t be detracted if this turns into a conversation and don’t block your direct out. If they want more clarification or details into what you’re discussing, that is a data point in itself. Give them the data and use that to calculate whether or not to open the discussion up wider to the rest of the team.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>The last whatever minutes you have are now to discuss goals. Short term and long term goals. Discuss what the next week looks like. Opportunities ahead and how you see that the direct can capitalize on any that are at their disposal. Discuss some areas of weakness you feel that they should concentrate and focus on in the next week. Revisit larger goals and discuss their progress. Keep the eye on the prize.</p>

<p>Sure discussions of promotions may come up in these 1:1’s when you discuss the future. I will do a separate post on how to discuss promotions. For now feel free to discuss that in the realm of long term goals. If that is the most pertinent goal then so be it, but relate it back to pressing matters in the short and long term. Relate it back to the goals you have hopefully setup with them in the past 3 months.</p>

<h2 id="the-implementation-details">The implementation details</h2>

<p>Setup your 1:1’s for a tight feedback loop. Keep your ability to calibrate tight and in-turn with the world that the individual is operating in. Like goals, keep your influence as agile as possible. For this reason I hold my 1:1’s weekly. They’re added to both my direct’s and my own calendars and repeat weekly. I check in with my direct before scheduling to try find a time that works for us both. Once its on the calendar it signifies to the individual that their time is important to me and that I am not above dedicating 30mins a week to them, because I’m not. It’s my job and this is a tool to do my job.</p>

<p>So 30mins for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 - 30mins for them</li>
  <li>10mins for me (if there is time)</li>
  <li>10mins for the future (if there is time)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-effective-manager">The Effective Manager</h2>

<p>Now there may be push back if you’ve held off for so long to get 1:1’s onto the calendar. “Not another meeting”! is something you may hear. Perhaps you’ve used 1:1’s in the past only for negative feedback and your direct is rejecting the fact they need more of the past. Try and rebuild the trust and run them through the proposed feedback.</p>

<p>I highly recommend reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2zeUl2h">The Effective Manager</a>. They go into much more detail on what to say in 1:1’s when you’re just starting them up for the first time. How to prove their value, and what to do when a direct flat out says no. Please read it. It seriously changed my approach to management and gave me the confidence needed. It more importantly gave me back one of the most effective management tools in my toolkit.</p>
