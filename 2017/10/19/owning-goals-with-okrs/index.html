	<h1>Owning goals with OKRs</h1>
		<p>Goals are a vital ingredient for us to carry out a set of tasks in an efficient manner. A goal is the purpose for your actions. Without a goal, why are you doing what you’re doing? Its when we fully understand and internalize our goals that we create a sense of purpose and self worth. That our actions are bringing us closer to an objective and in turn, have meaning and value. Our efforts are then not fruitless, as mundane as they may sometimes appear.</p>

<p>You might be one of many that sometimes lose grasp of your own life goals, career goals, fitness, financial, relationship, whatever it may be goals. When that happens we lose grasp of direction and then potentially even spiral down into a loss of aspiration, self worth and so on. The same can be seen when your manager or lead fails to communicate and form agreeance of common or personal goals. So no wonder you may have disdain for your job. You don’t know why you’re doing your immediate task, or you may not even know why your job exists in the first place! Eekkk.</p>

<p>The process of setting goals is extremely important. Goals need to be well defined, obtainable, clearly communicated and understood. Once individuals start seeing the goal posts being setup, and the point of the goal posts, they will internalize the reason for the how. The how being the steps or actions needed to get to that goalpost.</p>

<p>I hope to detail the importance of goals and techniques I’ve used in setting, communicating, getting team members  to own and strive to achieving the goals laid out. We’ll start off by reviewing the tool, then get into the techniques, then the findings and discussions.</p>

<h2 id="okrs">OKRs</h2>
<p>OKRs: Objectives and Key Results <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Its a nice acronym for basically coming up with some overarching goals and then breaking out measurable deliverables that would independently contribute to the success of that objective. Let’s start by taking an example of an objective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Increase Code Quality”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty straight forward. The objective is to heighten the quality of code. A little open ended yes, but that is the objective. Code that is pre-existing or about to get into the codebase, needs to be of a higher quality than what preexisted. You’re wondering now, “okay, but that doesn’t give anyone any idea as to what exactly needs to be done?” This is where key results come into it. Let me break this down into a format now for which you may present to a direct.</p>

<p><em>Objective:</em> Increase Code Quality
<em>Key Results:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>All PR’s (pull requests) to have minimum of 90% code coverage</li>
  <li>10 PR’s to be conducted with TDD</li>
  <li>Pair on 5 stories, start to finish, with a team member outside of our team</li>
  <li>Review 20 PR’s in and outside of the team</li>
  <li>Create 8 improvement cards</li>
</ul>

<p>So first off. What you see above are key results. Key results are quantifiable. You should imagine your key results as a slider. Did I or did the individual get 80% of the goal, 120% of the goal etc. Each set of key results is to be placed on the same timeline as the objectives. That way all key results can be measured fairly without any time bias. It also allows you to create key results in a way that is almost like a perfect recipe for achieving the objective.</p>

<h2 id="the-timeline">The timeline</h2>

<p>The OKRs I set up with my directs are revisited and adjusted every 3 months. Reviewing OKRs however occurs on a weekly basis. This duration I find to work quite well. Its a target that the individual can visualise and work back from. They might have some personal activities or events coming up at work that they can take into account and factor in to how they might approach it. This cadence also allows for objectives and key results to be tweaked. Keeping goals and deliverable targets somewhat agile and pragmatic in the project’s development.</p>

<p>Reflection and visualization are tools I strongly encourage you as a member to look into. I find having a weekly cadence is a great way to enforce reflection and also trigger visualization motions to come into play. I will get into that more later however in communicating OKRs.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-define-an-objective">How to define an objective</h2>
<p>First of all, as a manager, your job is aligning your team in a way that will successfully achieve whatever the wider goals may be, hopefully with longevity of the team at mind. With this said, coming up with objectives should be structured on an individual basis. It is very much circumstantial to the strengths, weaknesses and personal goals of the individual. Ensure both short-term and longterm goals are factored in here, as it should not just be the goals of the immediate project that the objectives are catered to. Instead longer term career aspirations and developmental objectives should be factored in also.</p>

<p><em>Some examples of objectives:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Swim faster</li>
  <li>Understand Jazz</li>
  <li>Start a potluck for the office</li>
  <li>Find a new office manager</li>
  <li>Be Amazing</li>
</ul>

<p>These are objectives remember. Not goals. We strive to improve on our objectives, but we strive to achieve our key results. Thus our goals are to achieve our individual key results so that we are working towards our objectives and in turn the goals of the team are realized. It’s a meta way of breaking down team goals down into traits, categories or objectives. From objectives we find success metrics upon various tasks and or deliverables that contribute to the goal of the objective. See how that bubbles up? But how do we break it down? How do you identify what components would makeup the success or advancement of an objective? Let’s examine the KR’s, the key results.</p>

<h2 id="key-results">Key results</h2>

<p>Now we step into the actual definitions of goals and expected outcomes. The key result are tangible deliverables you are able to accurately track. Whether it be measured in terms of a “delivered x” number of things, or the ability to put in place a quality metric. Whatever metric is selected to measure the key result, it most certainly needs to be clearly defined and without any grey area as to its measurement.</p>

<p>OKR’s can be boolean yes. However as a manager really if you are finding that the KR’s you’re defining are trending to be all boolean and similar in nature, perhaps you are actually defining the objective and not key results? Key results work best when there is a particular target of multiple observations. This also enables the ability to set key results up in the sense of stretch goals. So in the very nature if you feel a developer can achieve reviewing 10 pull requests a week, why not try setting that number to 15 and seeing how performance tracks. If you set a target, at least you will be able to see how people are tracking against the target. This may sound a bit unrealistic, however please see the next section for how to communicate key results.</p>

<p>So for some examples that I give my senior developers. Three categories stand out: Delivery, Influence, Quality:</p>

<h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Deliver 3 Pr’s a week. 36 in Total</li>
  <li>Do 10 PR’s with TDD</li>
  <li>Assist with 3 Platform Items</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="influence">Influence</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Attend 80% of Developer Demos</li>
  <li>Present 3 Developer Demos</li>
  <li>Run 2 Standup/Grooming/Planning Sessions</li>
  <li>Check in with another member of another team 5 times for at least 30mins</li>
  <li>Find 4 PR’s that need help and sit with the individual to refactor/fix</li>
  <li>In our 1:1’s demo 5 areas of improvement</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Review 30 PR’s</li>
  <li>Pair on 7 Stories - Start to Finish</li>
  <li>Present clean code findings in 5 1:1’s</li>
  <li>Generate 10 Improvement cards</li>
  <li>Write 3 forum or blog posts on technical areas of interest</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementing--communicating-okrs">Implementing &amp; communicating OKRs</h2>

<p>When I first kicked off OKRs as a tool for setting individual goals it was quite interesting. At first I got a lot of confusion from my directs. They felt that they were being tracked to a tee of their delivery. They felt that this was going to relate directly to their performance reviews. If they didn’t nail their OKRs, of which both of us had visibility on, that then they would see less monetary value at the end of the year.</p>

<p>I approached this somewhat interesting circumstance by decoupling it immediately. Instead I highlighted that <strong>the OKRs are nothing but a tool for you to reflect and visualize your next week</strong>. I had to stress that they were only a tool I had set up for the individual that split out an objective into a means for which the individual could get more focus on. It was merely a way to break down a somewhat overbearing goal into managable chunks.</p>

<p>Once it was established this was just a tool at their disposal they immediately fell in love with the power it gave them. It provided insight into how they were tracking against their objectives. Some directs took so much ownership on their OKRs they started mini self retro’s on their Trello board. Saying what worked well and what didn’t work well in relation to the objectives in their OKRs, and how they failed to meet some key results they previously thought they would of achieved that week.</p>

<p>They reflected, and they visualized how the next week would work. This is the exact feedback cycle I had hoped to create in my 1:1’s; yet it was now coming from within the team members.</p>

<h2 id="using-okrs-in-11s">Using OKR’s in 1:1’s</h2>

<p>A mentioned above, Objectives and the key results were tweaked every 3 months. Key results however were reviewed every week and discussed in detail during 1:1’s. I wanted to get insight into how the direct felt they were going upon reflecting on their key results. Why didn’t they get their target? Also more alarmingly and I guess more rewardingly is why are some key results not moving at all. This fast feedback cycle allowed both of us to calibrate how the next week would pan out. What I could do as a manager to open up opportunities or formulate the teams activities in a way that could best achieve these objectives.</p>

<p>To begin with we used to walk down the key results together. It felt a little micromanaging at first but it was a neccessity to getting both of us comfortable using the tool. It also proved to build trust between both of us as blame was never put on the individual if results weren’t being met, instead ways to look to the future on how to achieve the objectives was far more beneficial.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-performance">But what about performance</h2>

<p>I hear you asking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So if you don’t uphold poor delivery on the key results, then what is the point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well let’s think of it this way. If you as a manager have set up your OKR’s correctly and if you are giving constant feedback on performance (not related to the OKRs) then really, those key results should be moving on their own.</p>

<p>It all comes down to feedback; and you monitoring the individual’s performance outside of the key results you’ve put forward. Is the person focused? Is product or the project manager promoting opportunities for the individual to be productive and achieving previously agreed goals. if the team is healthy and the individual is productive, then you should be seeing results against the objectives you have set out.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>OKRs are only a tool. Its not a tool for performance reviews. Its a tool to break down a broad and complex objective, into targets that can be visible and understandable to the human brain. Its an amazing tool for individuals to get reflection in 1:1’s on the week they just had and the week they’re about to head into. They’re fine grained enough to tap into peoples strengths and improve upon people’s weaknesses whilst still allowing the project’s goals to be kept in mind.</p>

<p>OKRs are difficult at first to implement. Especially if your team feels like a previous manager was a bit micromanagey. But build the trust that they won’t be upheld to the key results. Instead use your feedback on performance and areas of improvement without having the OKRs out on the table.</p>
