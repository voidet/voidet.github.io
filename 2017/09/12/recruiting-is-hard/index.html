	<h1>Recruiting Outsourcing To The Team</h1>
		<h3 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A Bit of Backstory</h3>

<p>I didn’t realize how difficult recruiting was until I started doing it myself.
Not only that; I was recruiting in the Bay Area. To say the market is
competitive is an understatement. The market is insane, with a heavy dosage of
crazy and a bump of “wow, you leave cupcakes at the doorstep of your candidates
house as part of your offer strategy?”¹ So competitive that video phone screens,
coding challenges for homework and even an onsite loop longer than half a day
seems to be beneath a lot of people.</p>

<p>Recruiting we all know is a logistical nightmare. Finding candidates, reviewing
resumes, scheduling phone screens, live coding rounds, on-sites, feedback loops,
offer packets and start dates with orientation scheduling etc. leaves… well…
very little time to do your own primary role, whatever that may be.</p>

<p>Shortcuts can’t be had however. You get the wrong candidate on your team and you
may be up in a scenario worse than you started with. Hiring the right candidate,
with minimal stress, where the entire team will be happy is the ultimate goal.
You will have added a friend and a capable worker to the seat next to them is
the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>This ultimate goal is most effectively achieved via <strong>ownership.</strong> Giving the
team ownership of their problems and empowering them to arrive at a solution.
<strong>Ownership</strong> on what they need from an individual and empowering them with a
voice and interactions throughout the entire recruitment process.</p>

<p>I outsourced. Not to a recruiter to do it all for me, but for the team to own
it.</p>

<h3 id="sweet-16">Sweet 16</h3>

<p>I never got a car for my sweet 16. Mainly because we don’t do that in the
southern hemisphere. 16 is just 2 years away from being able to legally do a lot
of things. Wait, no. Getting a car for a birthday is just absolutely ridiculous.
But let me paint the analogy.</p>

<p>You get this car as a gift. Its awesome. You really needed a car, and a weight
is lifted of your shoulders. You might have been expecting a car because you
live in Palo Alto and your friend Libby got a Jaguar for hers. But its not the
model you wanted. The brand is wrong, the stereo doesn’t have bluetooth and the
rims are 16” not 18”. It’ll do though. You feel spoilt for getting it, and feel
kind of morally wrong for saying inside your head “Well, it’ll get me from A to
B. I’ll just drive it at night so none of my friends see it” ⁴.</p>

<p>But really you wished you could have gotten a cheque from your parents and told
“Hey little princess. We’re going to go car shopping for our lovely little sweet
16 snookims’ this weekend. You can get any car you want!”. You could test drive
each car, finding something that suited your needs and really, your friends
needs.</p>

<p>Analogy probably lost. However, with the recruiting efforts I really wanted to
ensure the team had their say in what they wanted. Who they wanted to hire and
get a feel for the person they’re hiring. Can they see themselves working daily
with this person? Can they learn from this person (either from mentoring them or
themselves getting mentored)? Can this person bake cupcakes and clean up for
themselves?</p>

<p>My ultimate goal in this entire process is that the team owns and determines
what they need and is involved right through to the person starting to warm
their seat up on their first day of work. Why? So there is no doubt, this is a
mutual fit for all parties.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-identify-what-to-do">Step 1: Identify What To Do</h3>

<p>Someone valuable leaves the company. As the heat drains from their seat, so does
the mood of the team. “Why did that person leave?” “What could of we done to
make that person stay?” “Goodbyes are hard!” “I wish I got a box of cupcakes
delivered to my doorstep” are all questions a team gets hit with.</p>

<p>A vital question you and your team should be asking however is. What are we
going to do with the open position? The natural reaction is. Backfill it with an
identical person. Make sure their hair and eye color matches, ensure they have
drink out of the same funny snoopy mug “I want it just as snoopy mugish”. But
really. You should be asking. <strong>What does the team need</strong>.</p>

<p>It might be that the team in fact doesn’t need that position urgently filled.
Perhaps the resources allocated to that person is best used to reward key
members, or all members, on that team with compensation adjustments, promotions
into that role, more offsite training, more offsite fun, more offsite cupcakes!
Perhaps, that position could go to another office? Or plain and simply, maybe
you do need a replica of that blue eyed, orange haired muppet named beeker² that
was previously on your team.</p>

<p>Now I know putting forward to the team that “hey, lets just take the money and
split it up, they’ll never know” is something you don’t want to put forward to
the team itself. My point is though; understand what the pain points are for the
team. The talent on board. The holes causing pain and slowing delivery. Identify
them, ensure the team does also, and determine what to do with that position.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-but-who">Step 2: But who?</h3>

<p>So you’ve identified that yes, you need to backfill that role. Let’s take an
extremely abstract view on this in the Bay Area and say its for a Developer
Position. Determining the <strong>strategic reason</strong> for that position is absolutely
vital. Too often a developer leaves, we hire another developer that simply
codes. The view is too narrow and short sighted.</p>

<p>As someone in charge of hiring, like an endgame in chess and pawn promotion, you
get to identify the traits your team is sorely longing for in this developer.
Simply giving a coding challenge and saying “hire” is not enough. You are
building a team here, not building a product. Ultimately the team will build the
product, you just need to identify all the complimenting traits of which
comprise the team, so that a beautiful product pops out the other side.</p>

<p>So when you ask yourself or the team <strong>who should we be hiring</strong> think about
what holes outside of the primary role this individual can assist with. Some
areas I’ve seen come in the form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We lack mentors for our eager juniors. Find a mentor.</li>
  <li>Meetings are dull. No one speaks up. Find someone who asks lots of questions in
your interviews or phone screens.</li>
  <li>We are still using floppy disks to save our xCode projects to. Find someone that
is cutting edge tech and contributes to Swift Open Source projects</li>
  <li>We need innovation. Find someone who has their own side projects.</li>
  <li>All the devs are just doing data entry. Speak to some graduates that are unaware
of what data entry is and are keen to start low and learn.</li>
  <li>Architecture changes more frequently than Trump visits a golf course. Find
someone who has gone in and inherited a mess and come out with rainbows flying
behind them³</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on. Every team has their strengths and weaknesses. That’s because
each person on the team has their own set of beautiful strengths and weaknesses.
We’re humans. Luckily we’re different.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-does-the-cook-clean-up">Step 3: Does the Cook Clean Up?</h3>

<p>I don’t do too much cooking. So my answer is yes, sometimes. But seriously. This
is a question that you and the entire team, including leadership will have to
come to a consensus on. Do this before you start interviewing people. What are
the duties of this role. You’ve established the justification for the position,
you’ve identified the personality and traits for the position, now what are the
duties? what are the expectations?</p>

<p>I’ve made this mistake, and too late in the game. We do a full interview loop
and then discussions happen (more on the process later) and people are like
“Ohhh, I thought that person was meant to be coding. The last person we had in
this position, well, they used to code”. No. Get this sorted before you start
the process. Does the cook need to clean up? Team, tell me.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of clarifying roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Engineering managers should be expected to read code, but shouldn’t write code
or pick up stories. Reason: they should be able to relate to the day to day
struggles that is the life of a developer</li>
  <li>Product Managers should be in charge of setting up AB tests.</li>
  <li>Griffon the clown should be expected to jump inside of a lions mouth. Bozo did
it, R.I.P, it was the success of the circus leading up to the accident, but the
new clown should be expected to do the same.</li>
  <li>Developers should be in charge of writing UI Automation tests. Our team is
headed in the direction of every QA is a developer, so, develop all of the
things.</li>
</ul>

<p>You get the gist I hope. You really should be clarifying this with the team
prior to posting the job description so that 1. they ask pertinent questions to
the candidate 2. they don’t oversell or undersell a candidate due to a
misalignment of expectations 3. You hire a developer not a clown 4. You don’t
get a messy kitchen after all the cupcakes that have been baked.</p>

<h3 id="interlude">Interlude</h3>

<p>So we now know what, why and who we’re hiring. Remember at the beginning of this
I mentioned I outsourced to the team. A large practical part of that comes in
the form of the process. But as someone who has had influence on hiring, a lot
of the what, why and who is up to you to investigate with the team. Understand
their pain. Speak to leadership on strategic long term decisions. Basically
weigh up all options and determine the best position and personality for the
team and the company.</p>

<p>Outsourcing to the team comes next. Prepare to feel like a personal assistant
and people wrangler. The goal of this, <strong>ownership</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-the-process">Step 4: The Process</h3>

<p>This next step is going to be a bunch of practical advice. To how I structured
the interview process to how to avoid common mistakes at crunch time.</p>

<h4 id="finding-candidates">Finding Candidates</h4>

<p>I was lucky to have 10 external vendors and 1 internal unit (lets call it the
recruiting team) bombard us with resumes for open positions. The recruiting team
would already be helping the process by pre-filtering.</p>

<p>Some key aspects of the what, who and how were captured in a document by the
team and handed to the recruiters. So before any resume came in front of the
team’s eyes there would be a prescreening. Some things that were useful to
include, an iOS developer as an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimum experience (5 years for intermediate dev, 7+ senior etc)</li>
  <li>Must know Swift 3 &amp; Objective C</li>
  <li>Experience with TDD, provide an answer as to what it is and why it is beneficial</li>
  <li>Explain what an Optional is? (pun intended)</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions were asked by the recruiters over a telephone screen and answers
were recorded and presented (if obvious/confident in the answers). Of course you
have to get the recruiters up to speed as to what TDD is, what an optional is.
Experience however, usually black and white.</p>

<h3 id="the-phases">The Phases</h3>

<p>Now each of the phases below in the process are done in pairs. Pairs so that a
high level of exposure is on the candidate for the team, and the candidate has
an exposure of the team they may be working in. Pairs are also great at
deliberating on the outcome on how to proceed. Well in my experience, the debate
is sometimes magical to watch as it relates back to the who, what and why.</p>

<h4 id="the-team-gets-notified">The Team Gets Notified</h4>

<p>They passed the first round! Next up I, the hiring manager, get the resumes. I
collect the resumes and put them on a Trello board. I also put up the responses
by the candidate (check out HireVue if you haven’t).</p>

<p>The Trello board is organised by two sections. First: Open positions by Level.
For example I’d have columns for “Engineering Manager” “SDE II” “Senior” “SDE I”
or however many thousand levels you have in your organization. Second: The
process of which candidates are in.</p>

<p>The idea here is that any cards in the Levels column has not yet been reviewed.
So that’s what happens. I send out a link to everyone on the team, and wider
team, to go about reviewing the resume and responses. I get direct comments on
the card with a summary of interesting points (something which people may of
missed and should consider in their vote) and then say proceed/no proceed.</p>

<p>I only require 2+ comments to proceed until I kick off the next phase. You have
to act fast, as a duty to the team and the candidate. Bay Area is insane, offers
are almost arriving by post these days (I just moved houses, so maybe the mail
redirect isn’t in effect yet), so you have to act fast to get into competing
offers.</p>

<h4 id="the-team-phone-screen">The Team Phone Screen</h4>

<p>As I mentioned the Trello board section 2 is by phase in the interview process.
The next step is the phone screen after the initial recruiter call. This is the
first interaction with the team and it is critical you invest time here. Again.
Critical that your interview panel knows what, who and how for the candidate
going into this.</p>

<p>So saying this, we have tweaked the phone screen. It as above mentioned will be
conducted by a pair of team members plus the candidate and to be segmented as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intros (5mins)</li>
  <li>Questions from the team (technical, behavioral, whatever is pertinent to the
role and the teams need) (30mins)</li>
  <li>Live coding or hypothetical scenarios for non technical positions (15mins)</li>
  <li>Questions from the candidate (10mins)</li>
</ul>

<p>Might sound rudimentary. But, we tweaked it for a reason. That reason being we
can’t afford a person to come into the office and then bomb hardcore because
really, they don’t know what XCTest is (this is just an example, did not
actually happen with XCTest, I think).</p>

<h4 id="code-it-code-it-live">Code it. Code It Live.</h4>

<p>Now for technical positions, if the person did not do one of our HireVue rounds
(which we are still setting up) then we will do the team phone screen then a one
hour live coding challenge. This is done in the IDE of the user’s choice. It may
be a real world problem. It may be a boilerplate codebase we setup and let them
debug. It may be bake us some cupcakes from your CLI. Whatever teases out the
traits the team needs, right?</p>

<p>So for example. Our team thrives/needs people that collaborate at the utmost
ease. So pairing remotely on a technical problem has been a strategy for us.
We’ve given problems and hope candidates ask us questions to elaborate. In fact,
our developers love it when candidates ask us how would we solve it better, then
we get stumped and work on it together.</p>

<p>My point is. Find the <strong>who</strong> in this candidate. It links back to the why. Once
you know the gaps, you try and see if this person can fill it. Maybe you just
need someone to build out an algorithm that just bakes cupcakes and cleans up
after itself ⁵. Then just hit on that.</p>

<h4 id="the-onsite">The Onsite</h4>

<p>Yusssss! They made it through the gauntlet of code or behavioral questions or
recipe challenges and you <strong>love the candidate</strong>. Now comes the onsite. How I
break down the interview process for a developer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Welcome the candidate and give them a tour of the office. Show them the desk
  they may be working at. This is a two way street here. You get them comfortable
  in the environment from the get go and also they get to see how messy and dirty
  their desk is ⁶ (Point of contact 15mins)</li>
  <li>Project Management Interview (pair 45mins)</li>
  <li>Discussion with Design &amp; Product (pair 30mins)</li>
  <li>Live coding exercise (pair with pairing 45mins)</li>
  <li>Lunch (pair wines and dines the candidate 45mins)</li>
  <li>Architectural Round (pair 45mins)</li>
  <li>Live coding Exercise (pair 45mins)</li>
  <li>Engineering Managers (pair 45mins)</li>
  <li>Recap and closing questions (Point of contact 15mins)</li>
</ol>

<p>Pair = Two members of the team interviewing/working/laughing with the
candidate<br /> Point of contact = A familiar face to go to if scheduling messes
up, or any particular questions outside the scope of a session. A Hi &amp; Bye
person (can also be in one of the sessions).</p>

<p>There are a few universal items in this list that fall outside of a developer
role and should be tweaked accordingly. 45mins is a great amount of time. The
candidate shouldn’t start yawning. Neither should you. We’ve had feedback from
candidates and interviewers as to the pain of the 1hr.</p>

<p><strong>Stick to your discipline.</strong> How annoying is it as a candidate to be asked the
same question from all of the people you meet? What is this, a police
interrogation to see if your story lines up. No. It isn’t. Focus on your
discipline and target that area. Project managers in the interview, focus on
delivery, priorities. Design &amp; Product, focus on what they think is important
for vision and competing priorities. Developer rounds, why are you asking what
motivates them? There is an Engineering Manager round, find out if they can
code!</p>

<p>Also there is no overlap with interviewers outside of the scope of the point of
contact. The members shouldn’t cut across disciplines, no matter how talented
the individual is. The aim is to have a deep cross cut of disciplines and
exposure to the team.</p>

<p>But don’t forget. You represent the company. You also are a salesmen and a
spokesperson for the company and the role itself. Do you think the candidate
wants to work with you after you give them a tree balancing algorithm of which
really, doesn’t have relevance to the role. This isn’t about you stroking your
own ego as an interviewer. Its about the what, why and how. Focus on that, not
how much better you can balance a tree.</p>

<p>You can tell a lot about a candidate by their questions. Leave 1omins in each
slot to allow for questions. What do they ask? Is it generic? Is it role
specific? Start thinking what questions you wish the candidate has and what that
may mean. For example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I really love reactive functional programming? What does your team think of that
development paradigm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: They’re in touch with their technical self. They’re eager for new
tooling. They want to try new things? They may be not a good fit if they expect
to use it? Question the meaning… of their questions. Are they all generic “What
do you like about working here?” Is it a worn and torn question and not
imaginative? Or do they want a quick summary of the awesomeness that you helped
create.</p>

<p>So the steps above are for a developer. But really find the disciplines the
person will be rubbing up against, and throw targeted pairs at the candidate.
Get the interviewers to be at inner zen with what the teams needs are, and get
them honing in on these needs/traits like an alcoholic hearing last call.</p>

<h4 id="the-huddle-1234">The Huddle… 1…2…3…4</h4>

<p>This is not American football. But rather the process in by which the team
decides if they’ve chosen a new member of their wolf pack. Traditionally a
hiring manager will take in all feedback from each phase, in isolation, and then
decide on how to proceed. It comes down to one brain to decide if the no hire
feedback from a pair, really should be discarded (yeah I heard red alert alarms
also).</p>

<p>No! This is not how it should be done. The team should decide on how to proceed.
Basically it comes down to this. Does the team agree that it is a hire. Some
people may say no, some yes. So how do you decide? The team does. So how do we
achieve this? We throw up gang signs in the air. A one, two, three or a four.
What do they mean?</p>

<ol>
  <li>The candidate should have never come on site.</li>
  <li>I really have some concerns here, but there were some positives, but really, I
  don’t think so. No hire.</li>
  <li>I really liked the person. Sure they didn’t have all the experience or bombed on
  one part, but there is room to grow. I vote hire.</li>
  <li>Wow! I should quit my job and they can be my replacement, because, that person
  really shouldn’t of been walking out of this office without having an offer in
  their hand and signature on the paper! Hire!</li>
</ol>

<p>All at once we put our hands in the air and vote. We look around the room and
tally it up. If its unanimous, then its quick. Hire/no hire. But what if you get
the majority of 2’s and threes ⁷. We have a debate.</p>

<p>Since it was divided up by discipline we talk it out as if it were strengths and
weaknesses. Does the team believe the strengths and weaknesses fall in line with
the what, who and how requirements of the team? If so. Hire.</p>

<p>If the weaknesses are just, “nope” then no hire. Obviously. So how do you arrive
at that after 30mins of debate, tears and almost civil war in the office? Throw
up the gang signs once more and then leave it at that.</p>

<p>Majority (and then some) 3’s? Hire :D<br /> If not, sorry :(</p>

<h3 id="some-prince-of-persia-pitfalls">Some Prince of Persia Pitfalls</h3>

<h4 id="respect-the-process-to-respect-the-team">Respect the Process to Respect the Team</h4>

<p>Don’t start up the next day and revisit this issue. Sure you’re attached to the
individual. You put up a 4. But the team has spoken. If the team has understood
what they want, hit on that in the interviews, spoke as a collective and
collectively arrived at a decision, then respect that. By you or anyone else
trying to sway or revisit the decision you undermine the entire process and
faith in people’s voice. Don’t do it. It ain’t worth it.</p>

<h4 id="you-are-not-a-cia-operative-unless-youre-in-the-cia">You Are Not a CIA Operative. Unless You’re In the CIA</h4>

<p>Interviewing by discipline really should alleviate this issue here. But if you
ask the same questions across discussions, don’t try see if the answers check
out between sessions. The person no doubt is not lying to you. They are just
recalibrating their tone.</p>

<p>Guess what. Humans learn, its one of our redeeming features. We learn in an
interview if posed with the same question, whether or not we liked our own
answers, or the reactions or follow up questions you gave to us and you know
what? We’re going to change our answers if posed with the same challenging
question.</p>

<p>You don’t have a badge, this isn’t detective work. Trust people and don’t try to
discover or uncover something that isn’t there. You don’t have the detective
background. Unless you’re from the CIA.</p>

<h4 id="no-hallway-chat">No Hallway Chat</h4>

<p>Bias really hurts the final voting round. If you come out of a session all
excited, or all upset because you wasted 45mins of your life, then keep it to
yourself. Too many times I have seen people in the “huddle” round say “At first
I was a 3, but then I spoke to x and I changed it to a 2”.</p>

<p>No. You interviewed the candidate, you arrived at that number. The huddle is
designed to be an all encompassing discussion with multiple points of view from
various disciplines. Stand true to yours and you will be fair to the team.</p>

<h4 id="isolation-leads-to-devastation">Isolation leads to devastation</h4>

<p>If there is one parting bit of advice I can give to you, is that, don’t put this
candidate in a box. Don’t think of them as just the person sitting in front of
you. Always, I mean like seriously, print a large photo behind their head if you
need to, imagine this person on the team.</p>

<p>You need to be in the mindset of what the team needs. By saying that you need to
visualize and pose questions, and interpret answers in how that may translate to
the team’s needs and operations. Don’t run into the trap of just targeting
technical skills if really your team needs high collaborative efforts.</p>

<p>This person is going to be working on a team. Focus on how they will help this
team from the get go. Understand if they can work on the team by presenting
questions posed in this context. The individual’s influence falls outside (well
outside) of just delivery.</p>

<h4 id="identify-it-get-over-it">Identify It. Get Over It.</h4>

<p>You ask a question. You get blown away by how awesome it was. Stop asking the
same question. Your job is to see if the individual aligns with the teams needs.
So if you can successfully identify a strength, good. Move on to find more
strengths outside of that trait. Start looking for weaknesses and areas of
growth. Feel free to pivot in this interview. Get the widest picture of the
person possible.</p>

<h4 id="setting-expectations">Setting Expectations</h4>

<p>Something that I have found prove exceptionally beneficial is setting
expectations in an interview. Things like “I have seen this prove extremely
successful on the team in the past. Do you think you would be comfortable doing
the same going forward? Or do you have any ways you could improve on x?” See how
they respond. Because if the team has an expectation for a particular task to be
done, and the candidate isn’t comfortable and they’re sitting at the desk tears
welling up in their eyes wishing then never took the job, then guess what. Start
the process over again.</p>

<h4 id="be-real-to-the-candidate">Be Real To The Candidate</h4>

<p>Be honest as to the challenges or benefits the candidate will face if they come
on board. If you lost like 10 developers in the past month and velocity is
hurting then you know what. Tell them. As scary as it is to be honest. I would
rather have that than say no to potential candidates that didn’t see it as a
problem, only to lose a hired candidate due to asking “where are all the
developers? I quit”.</p>

<p>Promote your team, the position and the awesomeness that can be as well. Are
there exciting opportunities on the team. Sell it to me! I want the dirt, I want
the icing. I want the full picture.</p>

<h3 id="any-red-flags">Any Red Flags?</h3>

<p>I had this one come up recently. A candidate asked me at the end in the question
section. Are there any red flags on my session today? Step 1 to this: Get over
yourself. Step 2: Give the feedback. Here’s how it went down:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Wow, you guys are really exciting, thank you so much for your
time, also thanks for the cupcake, is this from Dropbox? Oh, before I leave, I
want to know how I went today, any red flags?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>My Internal thought process:</strong> Oh shit. Yeah. This person has put himself out
there. Yes they were great cupcakes. Wait what. Is he asking for direct
feedback, or are those cupcakes making him trip out? Whoa, he’s asking for
direct feedback! This person wants to grow as a person! <em>swallow</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What I actually said:</strong> Wow, you know what sure! So I really didn’t like how
you responded to my question around if you were comfortable presenting A/B test
results on a weekly basis. This is largely around because I said it was
extremely important to our team and the team loves it. It’s empowered them so
much and because of the insight the ownership of their tasks has increased
considerably. So yeah. That was a red flag. But really, I should have asked you
if you could also think of ways to provide alternate solutions to improve
ownership in the team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The response to that from the candidate isn’t important. It did however turn
into a healthy discussion with mutual respect for each other. I dare you to try
that with your candidates and even with your team on a regular basis. Feedback
is critical. Someone that can demonstrate they thrive on feedback…. 4.</p>

<h3 id="but-research-shows">But Research Shows</h3>

<p>There has been some internal backlash as to how our team has been doing
interviews. It comes down to the study from somewhere I haven’t yet looked up,
that the result of hire/no hire is unchanged after 5 interviewers interact with
a candidate. I say sure. That is all well and good. But what 5 interviewers
doesn’t give is the sweet 16 effect.</p>

<p>It doesn’t allow for the team to come together and make a decision that impacts
every single one of them. It is for this reason that myself and the team are
thriving on this highly hands on process. Is it working! Hell yeah it is! Are we
tweaking as it’s going. Yes!</p>

<h3 id="why-did-i-write-this">Why Did I Write This?</h3>

<p>I felt that I have a much deeper understanding on what makes a team due to the
absence of key team members. I’ve questioned what to do with the positions and
questioned others as to what they want. I have grown so much as an Engineering
Manager because of it. I’ve had exposure to the public and see amazing trends
and had to tweak the process considerably to hone in on the processes and filter
types in order to not waste my team’s time. I wrote this because I wanted to
share this and also to get insight into what you may take away from these
learnings and what you can give back. I wrote this because I had too much
coffee.</p>

<h4 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h4>

<p>[1] Dropbox actually does/did that. Sounds delicious to me.<br /> [2] Ever seen
Muppets? I personally would love a muppet on my team. I will raise this with the
team if a position opens up.<br /> [3] Nyan cat is a strong hire<br /> [4] I’m
totally making this stuff up. I tend to ramble and this is one of the cases. I
also live very close to Palo Alto, but have no concrete evidence of this
happening. I am very sorry. I have been reading the Elon Musk book where he
crashed his McLaren F1 in Palo Alto. So maybe this is where I drew the
relationship.<br /> [5] I do not work for Dropbox, but I wish they would send me
some cupcakes after all the shoutouts I’ve been giving them.<br /> [6] I’m
actually joking in case you are thinking of interviewing. We are actually really
tidy and ensure you get a brand new keyboard, mouse and wiped down desk before
you start. Seriously. Who wants a second hand developer keyboard? …… rhetorical
people.<br /> [7] If you got all 1’s you really failed at the previous steps. Go
outside, rethink your life and the recruitment process. Call up Dropbox and
request some sympathy cupcakes ⁸<br /> [8] I should stop using them as a bad
attempt of making this recruitment post interesting ⁹<br /> [9] Can’t stop, won’t
stop</p>
